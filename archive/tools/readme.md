This tool allows to get power grid status in France. Due to power shortage in Europe, French Government told that we could have power outage.

It was possible to know if power will be cut or disrupted at a given time. Those information came from RTE, the public company that manages the electricity transmission network, to secure the supply of electricity to all French people.
